A very basic tasklist tool for tracking upcoming events.

## Development

Clone, locally, then run `npm install` from inside the project folder.

Use `npm start` to run the service.

## Deployment

Requires google cloud tools (`gcloud`) to deploy and monitor.

Use `npm run deploy` to deploy the code to google cloud.

### Monitoring

Use `npm run logs` to access the live logs from the server.
